If condition
Example 1: Basic IF Condition
Suppose you want to check if the value in cell A1 is greater than 10.

=IF(A1 > 10, "Yes", "No")
	• If A1 contains a value greater than 10, the result will be "Yes".
	• If A1 contains a value less than or equal to 10, the result will be "No".
Example 2: IF with Numerical Output
You can also use numbers as the output:

=IF(A1 >= 50, 100, 0)
	• If A1 is greater than or equal to 50, the formula will return 100.
	• Otherwise, it will return 0.
Example 3: IF with Multiple Conditions (Nested IF)
If you want to check multiple conditions, you can nest multiple IF functions.

=IF(A1 > 80, "Excellent", IF(A1 > 50, "Good", "Poor"))
	• If A1 is greater than 80, it returns "Excellent".
	• If A1 is between 51 and 80, it returns "Good".
	• If A1 is 50 or below, it returns "Poor".
Example 4: IF with AND/OR
You can combine the IF function with AND or OR to test multiple conditions at once.
	• With AND:

=IF(AND(A1 > 10, B1 < 20), "Yes", "No")
		○ This will return "Yes" if both conditions (A1 > 10 and B1 < 20) are true; otherwise, it will return "No".
	• With OR:


=IF(OR(A1 > 10, B1 < 20), "Yes", "No")
		○ This will return "Yes" if either condition (A1 > 10 or B1 < 20) is true; otherwise, it will return "No".
Summary:
The IF function is highly versatile for decision-making tasks in Excel, allowing you to return different values based on logical conditions.



Code, i have used in project:
=====================================
=IF(E2>=50, "Senior",IF(E2>=30,"Adult","Teenager"))

How to convert the dates into month wise
======================================
=Text(column,"mmm") ----> It will print the month as jan,feb,mar....dec
=text(column,"mmmm")---> It will print full month name
